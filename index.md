# Free and Open Source, Linux Fan
Started using Linux with Lubuntu in early December 2019, now I can't think of anything else besides Linux :)

Fedora, Ubuntu, Silverblue, and of course Arch Linux, are my favorites.
Here are some of my setups:

# Songs
I sometimes make music with LMMS on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/falling_snowdin). They're mostly ambient, very repetitive songs which I prefer as I can listen to them while working. Go check them out.
